Thank you for your interest in Sciency. 


## Vision

Our vision is to make science accessible and relatable.

## Manifesto

* Scientists must learn the language in which science is done. Everyone else must be told science in the language they speak.
*  Attachment to past achievements; alternate source of knowledge; invite followers of ancient methods to make novel contributions to the current state of knowledge; way forward scientists to explore Ramanujan like ways of acquiring knowledge; easier to be a scientist harder to be a listener
* Importance of science education for the common people
* Universality of science, who does it who it applies to
* Valuable resource for scientists working in different fields
* Beyond paywalls.

## Grand Plan

We hope to radically increase the current scientific understanding of people with a special emphasis on non-English speaking communities. 

The first step in this direction is the creation of Sciency — a journal that will contain articles published in at least two languages.

We intend to diversify our means of communication to audio and video broadcasting but we must start with articles. The articles will constitute the authenticating factor for these broadcasts.

A major goal in this grand scheme would be the construction of a family of journals that are used by scientists themeselves which breaks down the paywalls the scientific community — an unfair system that somehow we haven't been able to outsmart.

### Sciency

| Phase | Description | Article Types | Submission Procedure |
|:---|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Pilot | Create a website for hosting the journal. Define the acceptance criterion for short articles. Promote the idea and publish accepted peer-reviewed articles. | Letter | email |
| α1 | Formalise the organisation. Find volunteers for copy-editing and promotion. Add usage statics.  Initiate meeting of requirements for promotion to a recognised journal status. | Letter | email |
| α2 | Design a user-feedback system. Create an automated authors' log-in and submission area. | Letter+  | web submission |
