What is the largest number you can think of? We may start with one, two, three and so on. We may be tempted to say that perhaps a billion billion? But then there's always a billion billion plus one. It is not too hard to see that regardless of which number we claim is the largest, we can always add one to it and make it even larger. So there doesn't exist any *largest* number. The question is ill-posed. 

पार्थ: सबसे बड़ा आंकड़ा क्या है, माधव? 
माधव: हम सोचना शुरु कर सकते है एक, दो, तीन से। इस हिसाब से हम सोच सकते है शायद करोड़ करोड़? 
पार्थ: हे माधव, परंतु हम हमेशा करोड़ करोड़ में एक जोड़ सकते हैं। ((यह तो पोपट हो गया ना?)) तो इस तर्क के अनुसार कोई भी सोची गई सबसे बड़ी संख्या में हम एक जोड़कर उससे भी बड़ी संख्या बना सकते हैं। तो मेरा प्रश्न गलत है क्या?

Alright, fair enough, but let us anyway denote by $N_0$ the number of numbers. Yes, we just agreed upon the fact that this can't be a number, at least not in the sense we are familiar with, but can we still ask the following: Is there a number which is even larger than this? To do this, we need to come up with a way of thinking about how to compare this strange number $N_0$ with other numbers of its type.

माधव: नहीं पार्थ! मान लो कि सारे आंकड़ों को हमने एक टोकरे में डाल दिया। टोकरे में रखी चीज़ों की संख्या को अ से संबोधित करते हैं। तुम्हारे तर्क के अनुसार यह तो तय है कि अ एक साधारण संख्या नहीं हो सकती। लेकिन कोई ऐसी संख्या है जो अ से बड़ी हो? 
पार्थ: पर हे माधव, मेरे छोटे नैन इन विशाल एवं विचित्र आंकड़ों की तुलना कैसे करेंगे?

Let us first try to understand how $N_0$ plus one can possibly stay $N_0$ otherwise it's title of being the largest number would already be in jeopardy. Consider a hotel with infinite (or in our notation $N_0$) floors. Let each floor be completely occupied by guests. Imagine that it is a grand luxury hotel and that each floor has just one guest. So now the number of guests equals the number of floors. Alright. Imagine a new guest arrives. The Hotel is completely full. And yet, we can accommodate the new guest. How? Well, we shift each guest at a given floor to the floor above. This way the ground floor becomes available while all the previous guests are still inside the hotel! Once the new guest takes her place in the ground floor we have again reached the configuration where there're infinite floors and each floor has one guest. This number earlier was $N_0$ and now it must be $N_0$ plus one. But since the configuration of the hotels is the same, we are forced to conclude that $N_0$ must be the same as $N_0$ plus one. Insane right? So what's going on here? Well, this is the reason why infinities are hard to deal with. Adding  or subtracting finite numbers to $N_0$ will leave $N_0$ unchanged. Take a moment to appreciate what just happened. When you're convinced read on to realise that the crazy has just begun.
