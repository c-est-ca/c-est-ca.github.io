What is the largest number you can think of? We may start with one, two, three and so on. We may be tempted to say that perhaps a billion billion? But then there's always a billion billion plus one. It is not too hard to see that regardless of which number we claim is the largest, we can always add one to it and make it even larger. So there doesn't exist any *largest* number. The question is ill-posed. 

पार्थ — सबसे बड़ा आंकड़ा क्या है, माधव?  
माधव — हम सोचना शुरु कर सकते है एक, दो, तीन से। इस हिसाब से हम सोच सकते है शायद करोड़ करोड़?  
पार्थ — हे माधव, परंतु हम हमेशा करोड़ करोड़ में एक जोड़ सकते हैं। ((यह तो पोपट हो गया ना?)) तो इस तर्क के अनुसार कोई भी सोची गई सबसे बड़ी संख्या में हम एक जोड़कर उससे भी बड़ी संख्या बना सकते हैं। तो मेरा प्रश्न गलत है क्या?

Alright, fair enough, but let us anyway denote by $$N_0$$ the number of numbers. Yes, we just agreed upon the fact that this can't be a number, at least not in the sense we are familiar with, but can we still ask the following: Is there a number which is even larger than this? To do this, we need to come up with a way of thinking about how to compare this strange number $$N_0$$ with other numbers of its type.

माधव — नहीं पार्थ! मान लो कि सारे आंकड़ों को हमने एक टोकरे में डाल दिया। टोकरे में रखी चीज़ों की संख्या को अ से संबोधित करते हैं। तुम्हारे तर्क के अनुसार यह तो तय है कि अ एक साधारण संख्या नहीं हो सकती। लेकिन कोई ऐसी संख्या है जो अ से बड़ी हो?  
पार्थ — पर हे माधव, मेरे छोटे नैन इन विशाल एवं विचित्र आंकड़ों की तुलना कैसे करेंगे?

Let us first try to understand how $$N_0$$ plus one can possibly stay $$N_0$$ otherwise its title of being the largest number would already be in jeopardy. Consider a hotel with infinite (or in our notation $$N_0$$) floors. Let each floor be completely occupied by guests. Imagine that it is a grand luxury hotel and that each floor has just one guest. So now the number of guests equals the number of floors. Alright. Imagine a new guest arrives. The Hotel is completely full. And yet, we can accommodate the new guest. How? Well, we shift each guest at a given floor to the floor above. This way the ground floor becomes available while all the previous guests are still inside the hotel! Once the new guest takes her place in the ground floor we have again reached the configuration where there're infinite floors and each floor has one guest. This number earlier was $$N_0$$ and now it must be $$N_0$$ plus one. But since the configuration of the hotels is the same, we are forced to conclude that $$N_0$$ must be the same as $$N_0$$ plus one. Insane right? So what's going on here? Well, this is the reason why infinities are hard to deal with. Adding  (or subtracting) finite numbers to (or from) $$N_0$$ will leave $$N_0$$ unchanged. Take a moment to appreciate what just happened. When you're convinced read on to realise that the crazy has just begun.

We now return to the question of comparing numbers like $$N_0$$. It will be useful to think of these numbers as describing the number of constituents making up some object. For concreteness, consider the set of odd numbers $$1,3,5,7\dots$$ and let $$N'_0$$ denote the number of elements in this set similar to how $$N_0$$ was the number of elements in the set $$1,2,3\dots $$. One way of comparing the two numbers could be to compare the sizes of the associated sets. If we can show that for each element in the first set there is exactly one element in the other set then we can say without any doubt that the sets are of equal size and thereby conclude that the numbers associated are equal. Else whichever set has more elements, we can declare the associated number to be larger. Reasonable? Now it is evident that we removed half the elements from the set $$1,2,3,4\dots$$ to obtain $$1,3,5,7\dots$$ so the number $$N_0$$  should be greater than $$N'_0$$. Right? Sure? What if we map $$1\to 1$$, $$2\to 3$$, $$3\to 5$$, $$4\to 7$$ and in general $$n\to 2n-1$$? We have a obtained one to one map between the elements of the first set and the elements of the second set. Thus by our accepted definition the two sets have the same size even though we created the second set by removing half the elements from the first! You were warned, infinities are crazy. We have thus reached the conclusion that $$N_0=N'_0$$. By a similar argument one can show that the set $$ \dots, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots $$ is just as large as the set $$1,2,3\dots$$ .  The foolhardy among still dare to ask if there can be a number larger $$N_0$$? Answer: Yes! The number of points in a line segment. If you can prove this independently, you're a mathematician of the first class. The rest of us mortals can consider reading the second part of this article.
